The supporting mathematical model is based on averaging procedures within the hybrid mixture theory. A computationally efÔ¨Åcient reduced formulation of the macroscopic balance equations that neglects the relative acceleration of the Ô¨Çuids, and the convective terms is adopted. The modiÔ¨Åed effective stress state is limited by the Drucker‚ÄìPrager yield surface. Small strains and dynamic loading conditions are assumed. The standard Galerkin procedure of the Ô¨Ånite element method is applied to discretize the governing equations in space, while the generalized Newmark scheme is used for the time discretization. The Ô¨Ånal non-linear set of equations is solved by the Newton method with a monolithic approach. Coupled dynamic analyses of strain localization in globally undrained samples of dense and medium dense sands are presented as examples. Vapour pressure below the saturation water pressure (cavitation) develops at localization in case of dense sands, as experimentally observed. A numerical study of the regularization properties of the Ô¨Ånite element model is shown and discussed. A non-isothermal case of incipient strain localization induced by temperature increase where evaporation takes place is also analysed. Copyright ¬© 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = {Explicit Runge-Kutta methods (RKMs) are among the most popular classes of formulas for the approximate numerical integration of nonstiff, initial value problems. However, high-order Runge-Kutta methods require more function evaluations per integration step than, for example, Adams methods used in PECE mode, and so, with RKMs, it is expecially important to avoid rejected steps. Steps are often rejected when certain derivatives of the solutions are very large for part of the region of integration. This corresponds, for example, to regions where the solution has a sharp front or, in the limit, some derivative of the solution is discontinuous. In these circumstances the assumption that the local truncation error is changing slowly is invalid, and so any step-choosing algorithm is likely to produce an unacceptable step. In this paper we derive a family of explicit Runge-Kutta formulas. Each formula is very efficient for problems with smooth solution as well as problems having rapidly varying solutions. Each member of this family consists of a fifty-order formula that contains imbedded formulas of all orders 1 through 4. By computing solutions at several different orders, it is possible to detect sharp fronts or discontinuities before all the function evaluations defining the full Runge-Kutta step have been computed. We can then either accpet a lower order solution or abort the step, depending on which course of action seems appropriate. The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated on the DETEST test set as well as on some difficult test problems with sharp fronts or discontinuities.},

Our formulation is based on fundamental physical principles ‚Äì namely, essential conservation and thermodynamics laws ‚Äì and we thus obtain a Clausius-Duhem inequality which is crucial for devising compatible constitutive laws. We then propose to model the solid behavior based on a generalized hyperelastic free energy potential ‚Äì with additional viscous eÔ¨Äects ‚Äì which allows to represent a wide range of mechanical behaviors. The resulting formulation takes the form of a coupled system similar to a Ô¨Çuid-structure interaction problem written in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formalism, with additional volume-distributed interaction forces. We achieve another important objective by identifying the essential energy balance prevailing in the model, and this paves the way for further works on mathematical analyses, and time and space discretizations of the formulation.},

To that purpose, we adapt and extend an earlier proposed approach devised for Ô¨Çuidstructure interaction in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework.

In particular, the large compliance and the porosity of the pulmonary tissue are critical for lung inÔ¨Çation and air inhalation, and the diaphragm, the pleura, the rib cage and intercostal muscles all play a role in delivering and controlling the breathing driving forces. In this paper, we introduce a novel poromechanical model of the lungs. The constitutive law is derived within a general poromechanics theory via the formulation of lung-speciÔ¨Åc assumptions, leading to a hyperelastic potential reproducing the volume response of the pulmonary mixture to a change of pressure. Moreover, physiological boundary conditions are formulated to account for the interaction of the lungs with their surroundings, including a following pressure and bilateral frictionless contact. A strategy is established to estimate the unloaded conÔ¨Åguration from a given loaded state, with a particular focus on ensuring a positive porosity. Finally, we illustrate through several realistic examples the relevance of our model and its potential clinical applications.},

    abstract = {A continuum model for lung parenchyma is constructed. The model describes the thermomechanical response over a range of loading rates‚Äîfrom static to dynamic to shock waves‚Äîand a range of stress states, including isotropic expansion, triaxial extension, simple shear, and plane wave compression. Nonlinear elasticity, viscoelasticity, and damage are included, with the latter associated with changes of biological function as well as mechanical stiffness. A Gram‚ÄìSchmidt decomposition of the deformation gradient leads to strain attributes that enter the thermodynamic potentials as state variables. A free energy function is designed for loading at low to moderate rates and tensile pressures, whereby the tissue response, with surface tension, is preeminent. An internal energy function is designed for wave propagation analysis, including shock waves, whereby compressibility of the air inside the alveoli is addressed via a composite stiffness based on a closed-cell assumption. The model accurately represents the response to triaxial loading, pressure relaxation, and dynamic torsion with relatively few parameters. Longitudinal wave speeds are reasonable for ranges of internal airway pressure and transpulmonary pressure. Airway pressure strongly affects the response to plane wave compression. Criteria for local injury and damage progression depend on a normalized energy density and its gradient, where the latter is paramount for impact problems involving fast pressure rises. Results suggest that local damage associated with edema is induced at load intensities much lower than those that would cause significant stiffness changes due to rupture, major tearing, or local collapse.},

    abstract = {The continuum theory of mixtures is used to describe a medium consisting of a solid phase and fluid phase, both compressible and attributed distinct deformation, temperature, entropy, and internal energy fields. Continuum balance laws are presented, and constitutive equations consistent with thermodynamic restrictions are postulated. Jump conditions for shock waves are established. Evolution equations for transient, i.e., unsteady, shock wave propagation are newly derived for an ideal mixture consisting of an arbitrary number of nonlinear thermoelastic solids, whereby inviscid thermoelastic fluid behavior is attained for a given constituent under more restrictive constitutive assumptions. Detailed calculations of Hugoniot response and shock decay are specialized to the case of a two-phase mixture of a single solid and a single fluid, where physical properties pertinent to lung parenchymal tissue containing air are assigned. Local constitutive behaviors for this lung mixture model correspond to a compressible neo-Hookean solid phase and an ideal gas fluid phase. Predictions of the model offer new information on origins of soft tissue trauma, in the context of prior experimental observations, for dynamic impact or shock loading of the lung.},

Moreover, proceeding from the interaction between an incompressible bulk fluid with a saturated biphasic porous medium with intrinsically incompressible and inert constituents, the characteristics of the governing equations are scrutinised, and the various constraints within the subsystems are identified. Following this, the method of perturbed Lagrange multipliers is used to replace the constrained equation systems within each subdomain by unconstrained ones. Furthermore, considering the one-dimensional (1D) version of the equations, a stability analysis of the proposed solution method is performed, and the unconditional stability of the partitioned solution scheme is shown. Solving 1D and 2D numerical benchmark examples, the applicability of the proposed scheme is demonstrated.}

    abstract = {Abstract Two finite element formulations are proposed to analyse the dynamic conditions of saturated porous media at large strains with compressible solid and fluid constituents. Unlike similar works published in the literature, the proposed formulations are based on a recently proposed hyperelastic framework in which the compressibility of the solid and fluid constituents is fully taken into account when geometrical non-linear effects are relevant on both micro- and macroscales. The first formulation leads to a three-field finite element method (FEM), which is suitable for analysing high-frequency dynamic problems, whereas the second is a simplification of the first, leading to a two-field FEM, in which some inertial effects of the pore fluid are disregarded, hence the second formulation is suitable for studying low-frequency problems. A fully Lagrangian approach is considered, hence all terms are expressed with reference to the material setting; the balance equations for the pore fluid are also expressed in terms of the chemical potential and the mass flux of the pore fluid in order to take the compressibility of the fluid into account. To improve the numerical response in the case of wave propagation, a discontinuous Galerkin FEM in the time domain is applied to the three-field formulation. The results are compared with analytical and semi-analytical solutions, highlighting the different effects of the discontinuous Galerkin method on the longitudinal waves of the first and second kind.

These challenges include the non-linear behaviour of the solid skeleton of the soil as well as the means by which the unsaturated nature of the multi-phase soil is dealt with. A review of some fundamental issues in partially saturated soils as well as the governing equations are presented and then the application of the generalised-a algorithm for time integration of the global equations of motion for unsaturated soils is demonstrated. Solutions to these equations obtained by the Ô¨Ånite element method are validated by recently presented analytical solutions. A description of the selected constitutive model and its integration is also presented, together with a strategy to verify the numerical implementation. Finally, solutions for the classic problem of static loading of a rigid footing resting on a partially saturated (three-phase) soil and a fully saturated (two-phase) soil are presented.},

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection‚Äìdiffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.}

Such problems present strong physical couplings arising from material and geometrical nonlinearities. In this regard, the present study investigates the numerical performance of five biphasic solution algorithms within the context of soft biological tissues: monolithic, drained, undrained, fixed-strain, and fixed-stress scheme. To this end, two classical tests were studied within a finite element framework: confined and unconfined compression tests. Since these tests behave differently in terms of biphasic coupling, the sensitivity of different permeability values and time increments to the algorithms‚Äô performance were assessed. The results highlight that iterative techniques perform well over the monolithic one for weak coupling cases but suffer from lack of convergence when the coupling strength increases. This means that, in contrast to what is recommended in the vast majority of geomechanics papers, the iteratively-coupled schemes are not always well-suited methods for problems related to soft biological tissues mechanics. The monolithic scheme thus emerges as the most reliable choice to solve biphasic problems in a biomechanics context, specifically when high coupling strength problems and small time increments take place.},

	abstract = {The compressive viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage, a fiber-reinforced, porous, permeable solid matrix filled with water, is predominately governed by the flow of the interstitial water within the tissue and its exudation across the articular surface. The fluid flow is in turn governed by the permeability of the tissue and the loading imposed upon its surface. But for articular cartilage, the permeability depends nonlinearly on the strain: k = ko exp(Me). Here, M is the nonlinear flow-limiting parameter and e is the dilatation. In this investigation, we studied the influence of M and Ro = koHA / UÀôh (where HA is the elastic equilibrium modulus of the solid matrix, h is the tissue‚Äôs thickness and UÀô is the rate of compression applied onto the surface via a rigid, porous, free-draining filter) on the stress history of circular plugs of cartilage specimens attached to the bone. It was found that these two parameters have profound effects on the predicted compressive stress history. For very large Ro, the fluid flow effects become negligible. For small Ro and large M, large instantaneous compressive stresses several times larger than those observed at equilibrium are predicted. This amplification of compressive stress is due to the increase of importance of the relative fluid flow effect, i.e., Ro ‚Üí 0, and nonlinear flow-limit effect, i.e., M {\textgreater} 0. Also, the theoretical curves predict that the rate of increase of stress initially decreases (convex) and finally becomes a constant. The results of our 5 percent offset compression experiments are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

    abstract = {The dynamic behavior of the lung in health and disease depends on its viscoelastic properties. To better understand these properties, several mathematical models have been utilized by many investigators. In the present work we present a new approach that characterizes the dynamics of gas flow into a viscoelastic porous medium that models the lung structure. This problem is considered in terms of the lung input impedance on a macro level and parenchymal tissue impedance on the level of an alveolar wall. We start from a basic theoretical analysis where macroscopic tissues deformations are represented in accordance with the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. This approach has strong theoretical underpinnings in other situations, but has not been applied to analyze the impedance of the inflated lung. Our analysis provides a theoretical basis for analyzing the interaction between flow into the lungs as a biophysical diffusion process and parenchymal viscoelasticity described phenomenologically, within the frameworks of standard viscoelasticity and structural damping. This lung impedance incorporates parameters of porosity, permeability, and viscoelasticity on micro and macro levels of parenchymal tissue. The analysis shows the theoretical basis of the transformation from the impedance of alveolar walls or isolated tissue strips to that of the intact parenchyma. We also show how the loading impedance at the lung boundary may have a significant impact on the dynamic behavior of whole lung viscoelasticity. Our analysis may be useful in directing specific tests of different models and for analyzing experimental measurements of viscoelastic parameters of lung material under normal and pathological conditions.},

Unlike many engineering materials, these tissues may typically experience finite deformations during normal, physiological activities. Accurate and efficient finite element formulations are required to solve large problems of experimental and clinical relevance. This manuscript describes two new 3-field (u-p-W) mixed finite element formulations based on Lagrange multiplier and Augmented Lagrangian representations of the saturation/incompressibility constraint. As a precursor, the continuum mixture theory for finite deformation, quasistatic poroelasticity with constituent incompressibility is first reformulated within the variational framework of the principal of virtual power. In doing so, the equivalence of the continuum mixture theory and Biot formulations for this problem is established. The improved performance of the mixed formulations over an analogous 2-field (u-W) penalty formulation is demonstrated using axisymmetric numerical examples.},

The precise time integration method is adopted in the algorithm to improve the computational accuracy.

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical approach for computing solutions to Biot's fully dynamic model of saturated porous media with incompressible solid and fluid phases. Spatial discretization is based on a three-field (u-w-p) formulation, employing a lowest-order Raviart-Thomas mixed element for the fluid Darcy velocity (w) and pressure (p) fields, and a nodal finite element for skeleton displacement field (u). The discretization is constructed based on the natural topology of the variables and satisfies the Lady≈æenskaja-Babu≈°ka-Brezzi stability condition, avoiding locking in the incompressible and undrained limits. Since fluid acceleration is not neglected, the three-field formulation fully captures dynamic behavior even under high-frequency loading phenomena. The importance of consistent initial conditions is addressed for poroelasticity equations with the mass balance constraint, a system of differential algebraic equations. Energy balance is derived for the porous medium and used to assess accuracy of time integration. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, a variety of numerical studies are carried out including verification with analytical and boundary element solutions and analyses of wave propagation, effect of hydraulic conductivity on damping and frequency content, energy balance, mass lumping, mesh pattern and size, and stability. Some discrepancies found in dynamic poroelasticity results in the literature are also explained.},

    abstract = {Proceeding from the governing equations describing a saturated poroelastic material with intrinsically incompressible solid and Ô¨Çuid constituents, we compare the monolithic and splitting solution of the different multi-Ô¨Åeld formulations feasible in porous media dynamics. Because of the inherent solid‚ÄìÔ¨Çuid momentum interactions, one is concerned with the class of volumetrically coupled problems involving a potentially strong coupling of the momentum equations and the algebraic incompressibility constraint. Here, the resulting set of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) is solved by the Ô¨Ånite element method (FEM) following two different strategies: (1) an implicit monolithic approach, where the equations are Ô¨Årst discretized in space using stable mixed Ô¨Ånite elements and second in time using stifÔ¨Çy accurate implicit time integrators; (2) a semi-explicit‚Äìimplicit splitting scheme in the sense of a fractional-step method, where the DAE are Ô¨Årst discretized in time, split using intermediate variables, and then discretized in space using linear equal-order approximations for all primary unknowns. Finally, a one- and a two-dimensional wave propagation example serve to reveal the pros and cons in regard to accuracy and stability of both solution strategies. Therefore, several test cases differing in the used multi-Ô¨Åeld formulation, the monolithic time-stepping method, and the approximation order of the individual unknowns are analyzed for varying degrees of coupling controlled by the permeability parameter. In the end, we provide a reliable recommendation which of the presented strategies and formulations is the most suitable for which particular dynamic porous media problem.

Our approach, which inherits some of its techniques from CFD, is characterized by the following aspects: (1) it only performs operator evaluation with no additional Gateaux derivatives. In particular, the computations of the time-consuming material tangent matrix are not involved here; (2) it solves the non-linear dynamic problem with no restriction on the strength of coupling; (3) it is more efÔ¨Åcient than the linear uvp solver discussed in previous works; (4) it requires weaker derivatives, and hence, lower-order FE can be tested; and (5) the boundary conditions are reduced, solution independent and more convenient to apply than in the old uvp formulation. For the purpose of validation and comparison, prototypical simulations including analytical solutions are carried out, and at the end, an adaptive time stepping procedure is introduced to handle the rapid change in the numbers of nonlinear iterations that may occur.

The quadratic convergence of Newton‚Äôs method for solving the highly nonlinear system with an implicit Ô¨Ånite element code is demonstrated. A u-p formulation is proposed where the time discretisation is carried out prior to the space discretisation. In this way, the derivation of all consistent moduli is fairly straightforward. Time integration is approximated with the Theta and Newmark‚Äôs methods, and hence the fully coupled nonlinear dynamics of porous media is considered. It is shown that the liquid retention model requires also the consistent second-order derivative for quadratic convergence.

FEA simulations include: (1) compressive uniaxial strain loading on a column of lung parenchyma with either pore air or water Ô¨Çuid, (2) out-of-plane pressure loading on a thin slab of lung parenchyma with either pore air or water Ô¨Çuid, and (3) pressure loading on a 1/8th symmetry vertebral disc (nucleus and annulus) with pore water.

	issn = {0029-5981, 1097-0207},
	doi = {10.1002/nme.1275},
	abstract = {The presented method stems from the works by Zienkiewicz and co-workers for coupled Ô¨Çuid/thermal problems starting from the early 1990s. They propose algorithms to overcome the difÔ¨Åculties connected to the application of the FEM to the area of Ô¨Çuid mechanics, which include the problems of singular behaviour in incompressibility and the problems connected to convective terms. The major step forward was to introduce the concept of characteristic lines (the particle paths in a simple convection situation): for a class of problems with a single scalar variable, the equations in the characteristic co-ordinates regain self-adjointness. The procedure is called characteristic based split algorithm (CBS). We use here a CBS-type procedure for a saturated deformable elastic porous medium, in which the Ô¨Çuid velocity is governed by Darcy‚Äôs equation (which comes directly from Navier‚ÄìStokes ones). The physical‚Äìmathematical model is a fully coupled one and is here used to study an incompressible Ô¨Çow inside a continuum with incompressible solid grains. The power of the adopted algorithm is to treat the basic equations in their strong form and to transform a usual ‚Äòu‚Äìp‚Äô problem into a ‚Äòu‚Äìv‚Äìp‚Äô one, where u generally indicates the displacement of the solid matrix and p and v the pressure and velocity of the Ô¨Çuid, respectively. Attention is focused on the expression of Darcy‚Äôs velocity which is considered as the starting point of the algorithm. The accuracy of the scheme is checked by comparing the present predictions in a typical consolidation test with available analytical and numerical u‚Äìp solutions. A good Ô¨Åtting among different results has been obtained. It is further shown that the procedure eliminates the oscillations at the onset of consolidation, typical for many schemes. The FEM code Ed-MultiÔ¨Åeld has been used for implementing and testing the procedure. Copyright ·≠ß 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

When flow rates used in measurements exceed the limits of linear Darcy‚Äôs flow regime we discuss what needs to be taken into account while processing the measurements. The study consists of two parts. In this part we briefly recall Darcy‚Äôs and Forchheimer‚Äôs laws and address the issue of detecting transition between ranges of their applicability. Then we describe the experiment and discuss 8 different ways to process measurement data, four for Darcy‚Äôs, and four for Forchheimer‚Äôs models. The main topic of the second part is to provide recommendations for the best ways to process data, so that the results obtained with numerical models are in the best agreement with the experimental data. The results shown in the two papers belong to a larger work devoted to modeling fluid flows through porous media, with a special interest in granular beds.},

The micromorphologic equivalents of human blast lung injury can be summarized as follows: diffuse alveolar overdistension, circumscribed interstitial hemorrhages showing a cufflike pattern around pulmonary vessels, venous air embolism, bone marrow embolism, and pulmonary fat embolism. Hemorrhages within the lung parenchyma that were present in this study in blast victims without coexisting blunt or penetrating chest trauma must be regarded as potentially life-threatening intrapulmonary bleeding sites in survivors. In addition, the potential clinical importance of the presence of massive pulmonary fat embolism, which has, to the best of our knowledge, not been described previously in human blast lung injury, must be emphasized because pulmonary fat embolism may be a leading cause of the rapid respiratory deterioration with progressive hypoxia and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in blast victims who survive. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that air embolism presenting in blast victims is not a mere ventilation-induced artifact. }

Extensions, such as a Forchheimer approach, may be required to include inertial effects. Our aim is developing predictive models for such landÔ¨Ålls that are built from the low-level radioactive waste and debris of dismantled nuclear power plants. It consists of different materials, which after crushing result in a spatially heterogeneous distribution of porous-media properties in the landÔ¨Ålls. Rain events or leakage, for example, may wash out radionuclides and transport them with the water Ô¨Çow. We investigate here the water Ô¨Çow and consider an inclusion of macropores. To deal with possibly high velocities, we choose the Forchheimer model and, taking different Forchheimer coefÔ¨Åcients into account, compare it to the Darcy model. The focal points of the study are (i) the inÔ¨Çuence of the macropores on the Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åeld and (ii) the impact of the choice of the Forchheimer coefÔ¨Åcient both on the solution and the computational effort. The results show that dependent on their size, macropores can dominate the Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åeld. Furthermore, Forchheimer coefÔ¨Åcients introducing more inertial effects are associated with considerably higher runtimes.},

    abstract = {Summary In terms of the three-field formulation of Biot's dynamic consolidation theory, the numerical manifold method (NMM) is developed, where the same approximation to skeleton displacement (u) and fluid velocity (w) is employed and able to reflect incompressible as well as compressible deformation, but the approximation to pore pressure (p) takes two different types, respectively. The first type of approximation to p is continuous piecewise linear interpolation and the second type assumes that p is a constant within each element. It is verified that using the second type of approximation to p naturally satisfies the inf-sup condition even in the limits of rigid skeleton and very low permeability, avoiding the locking problem accordingly. Energy components done by various forces are calculated to verify the accuracy and stability of the time integration scheme. A mass lumping technique in the NMM framework is employed to effectively reduce the unphysical oscillations and increase computational efficiency, which is another unique advantage of NMM over other numerical methods. A number of numerical tests are conducted to demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the proposed mixed NMM models.},

    abstract = {A quantitative evaluation of lung injury due to impact loading is of general interest. Hemorrhage and edema are the usual sequelae to traumatic pulmonary impact. To gain some quantitative understanding of the phenomena, we perfused excised rabbit lung with Macrodex at isogravimetric condition and monitored lung weight continuously after impact. It is shown that a factor of importance is the rigidity of the surface on which the lung rests. The rate of lung weight increase is smaller if the lung was ‚Äòfreely‚Äôsupported on a soft cloth, more if it was supported on a rigid plate. This suggests the influence of stress wave reflection. The critical condition correlates with the initial velocity of impact at the surface of the lung, or with the maximum deflection. For a freely supported lung, the rate of lung weight increase was 22 Y, of the initial total lung weight per h after impact when the impact velocity was 11.5 m s \_ ‚Äò, 30 oAwhen the velocity was 13.2 m s I, several lOO‚Äù/‚Äôat 13.5ms-‚Äô signaling massive lung injury. Since the velocity of sound in rabbit lung is 33.3 m SK‚Äô \&en the inflatidn (transpulmonary) pressure is 10 cm HZO, the critical velocity of 13.5 ms ‚Äô corresponds to a Mach number of 0.4. The maximum surface displacement of the lung is almost linearly proportional to the initial velocity of impact. The exact cause of edema and hemorrhage is unknown; we hypothesize that it is due to tensile stress in the alveolar wall caused by the impact.},

	abstract = {We investigate spatial stability with various numerical discretizations in displacement and pressure fields for poroelasticity. We study 2 sources of the early time instability: discontinuity of pressure and violation of the inf-sup condition. We consider both compressible and incompressible fluids by employing the monolithic, stabilized monolithic, and fixed-stress sequential methods. Four different spatial discretization schemes are used: Q1Q1, Q2Q1, Q1P0, and Q2P0. From mathematic analysis and numerical tests, the piecewise constant finite volume method for flow provides stability at the early time for the case of the pressure discontinuity. On the other hand, a piecewise continuous (or higher-order) interpolation of pressure shows spatial oscillation, having lower limits of time step size, although lower approximations of pressure than displacement can alleviate the oscillation. For an incompressible fluid, Q2Q1 can be better than Q1P0, because Q1P0 might not satisfy the inf-sup condition. However, regardless of fluid compressibility and the pressure discontinuity, the fixed-stress method can effectively stabilize the oscillation without an artificial stabilizer. Even when Q1P0 and Q1Q1 with the monolithic method cannot satisfy the inf-sup condition, the fixed-stress method can yield the full-rank linear system, providing stability. Thus, the fixed-stress method with Q1P0 can effectively circumvent the aforementioned 2 types of instability.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new formulation of smoothed particle finite element method (SPFEM) for dynamic problems in two-phase saturated porous media. A node integration method is used for both solid and water phases, which helps stabilize the coupled formulation when low-order triangle elements are used. Two different time integration schemes (i.e. explicit velocity Verlet and semi-implicit fractional step methods) are used to solve the coupled SPFEM formulations. In particular, a novel weakly-compressible fractional step algorithm is proposed, the key virtue of which is its capability to simulate high-frequency dynamic wave propagation in the porous media. The proposed coupled SPFEM is validated by comparing the numerical results with the analytical solution of two poroelastic examples, focusing on 1D wave propagation and 1D consolidation problems. Three more numerical tests are presented to further validate the proposed coupled SPFEM in simulating 2D wave propagation, self-weights slumping block and seepage flow induced progressive failure of embankment, and a very good agreement with the numerical results reported in the literature is obtained.},

	abstract = {The solution of problems in which coupling occurs between the displacement of the soil skeleton and the pore Ô¨Çuid pressure is fundamental in soil dynamics. The formulation requires that the interpolation functions for the displacement and pressure in the Ô¨Ånite element discretization must satisfy the so-called Babuska‚ÄìBrezzi stability criteria or the patch test in the limit of nearly incompressible pore Ô¨Çuid and small permeability. The criteria are not fulÔ¨Åled by elements with the same order of interpolation for both variables unless stabilization techniques are introduced. This paper summarizes the stabilization techniques that have been proposed in the literature to overcome volumetric locking for the incompressible or nearly incompressible soil dynamic behaviours. In particular, the staggered implicit‚Äìimplicit algorithm (i.e. the fractional step method in an implicit form) and the direct -method proposed by the Ô¨Årst author and Zienkiewicz et al. are brieÔ¨Çy reviewed. Attentions will be paid to the steady-state formulations resulted from both approaches. Based on the steady state formulations, the paper will then discuss the determination of the local stabilization parameters, with which a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement for the obtained solutions of pore-pressure can be achieved. Further discussion on the limitations of the methods is also given. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
